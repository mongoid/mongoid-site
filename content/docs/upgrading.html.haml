    Use this as a reference when upgrading between Mongoid versions.

.title Upgrading to 2.0.0.rc.1 +
.text
  %p
    Please note there are many changes in this upgrade - please take
    caution and be mindful of each item listed here. There were close to
    400 commits between beta 20 and rc 1, and was a COMPLETE REWRITE
    of all association code as well as refactorings and rewrites in many
    other areas. Unforeseen issues may arise. In case of emergency point
    at the <tt>safe_master</tt> branch or the tag of
    <tt>2.0.0.beta.20</tt> from bundler to potentially stay out of
    harm's way. :)

  %p
    And on to the changes...

  %p
    Relational associations no longer autosave when the parent relation
    is created. Previously a save on a new document which had a
    references_many or references_one association loaded would save
    the relations on it's first save. In order to get this functionality
    back, an <tt>:autosave =&gt; true</tt> option must be provided to the
    macro (This only applies to references_many and references_one):

  %pre
    %code.language-ruby
      :preserve
        class Person
          include Mongoid::Document
          references_many :posts, :autosave => true
          references_one :game, :autosave => true
        end

  %p
    For relational many-to-many associations, the
    <tt>:stored_as =&gt; :array</tt> option on references_many has been
    sacked. You will get an error on class load to change these to the
    new syntax:

  %pre
    %code.language-ruby
      :preserve
        class Person
          include Mongoid::Document
          references_and_referenced_in_many :preferences
        end

  %p
    Mongoid now validates all associated "child" relations by default,
    which is the opposite behaviour from the last release. You may
    remove any validates_associated definitions that do not require
    custom behaviour for the following relations:

    %ul
      %li <tt>embeds_many</tt>
      %li <tt>embeds_one</tt>
      %li <tt>references_many</tt>
      %li <tt>references_one</tt>

  %p
    If you do NOT want the automatic validation on these relations, you
    can supply the definition with a <tt>:validate =&gt; false</tt>
    option to turn it off:

  %pre
    %code.language-ruby
      :preserve
        class Person
          include Mongoid::Document
          embeds_many :addresses, :validate => false
        end

  %p
    Criteria object are now immutable, and return a new object with each
    method call. Also, the following methods have been added:

    %ul
      %li <tt>delete_all</tt>
      %li <tt>destroy_all</tt>
      %li <tt>create</tt>

  %p
    This allows for limited database update commands to happen off of
    a criteria object:

  %pre
    %code.language-ruby
      :preserve
        Person.where(:title => "Prince").create # => Creates one
        Person.where(:age.gt => 40).delete_all # => Delete all matching
        Person.where(:age.gt => 40).destroy_all # => Destroy all matching

  %p
    Mongoid now supports <tt>default_scope</tt> in a limited capacity:

  %pre
    %code.language-ruby
      :preserve
        class Person
          include Mongoid::Document
          field :name, :type => String
          default_scope asc(:name)
        end

  %p
    Mongoid now supports multiple additional database connections on a
    per-model basis. Note that the "databases" entry in the configuration
    is only for ADDITIONAL databases - the primary master still is
    configured as usual:

  %pre
    %code.language-yaml
      :preserve
        defaults: &defaults
          host: localhost
          slaves:
            - host: localhost
              port: 27018
            - host: localhost
              port: 27019
          databases:
            secondary:
              database: secondary_config_test
              host: localhost
              post: 27020
              slaves:
                - host: localhost
                  port: 27021
                - host: localhost
                  port: 27022

  %p
    To tell a model to persist to another database:

  %pre
    %code.language-ruby
      :preserve
        class Business
          include Mongoid::Document
          set_database :secondary
        end

  %p
    The <tt>inverse_of</tt> option is no longer required on any relation.

  %p
    Mongoid now allows recursive embedded relationships through 2 simple
    macros:

  %pre
    %code.language-ruby
      :preserve
        class Role
          include Mongoid::Document
          field :name, :type => String
          recursively_embeds_many
        end

        role.parent_role # => Gets the parent.
        role.child_roles # => Gets the children.

        class Role
          include Mongoid::Document
          field :name, :type => String
          recursively_embeds_one
        end

        role.parent_role # => Gets the parent.
        role.child_role # => Gets the child.

  %p
    <tt>:default_order</tt> No longer functions on relations and is a known
    issue.

  %p
    For third-party library developers, the internal Mongoid relation
    metadata has been revamped. Now when performing a
    <tt>Document#reflect_on_association(name)</tt> you will be returned a
    <tt>Mongoid::Relations::Metadata</tt> object, which now provides
    much more comprehensive information about the relation in question.

.title Upgrading to 2.0.0.beta.16 +
.text
  %p
    This version requires an upgrade to
    <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/downloads">MongoDB 1.6.0</a>.

.title Upgrading to 2.0.0.beta.15 +
.text
  %p
    If you had been using the class variable <tt>include_root_in_json</tt>
    for JSON serialization, this will no longer work. You will need to now
    use the global Mongoid configuration option of the same name in your
    <tt>mongoid.yml</tt> if you want to turn it on. (It now defaults to false.)

  %pre
    %code.language-yaml
      :preserve
        defaults: &defaults
          include_root_in_json: true

.title Upgrading to 2.0.0.beta.14 +
.text
  %p
    The <tt>:accessible =&gt; false</tt> option on fields has been
    removed in favor of <tt>attr_accessible</tt> and <tt>attr_protected</tt>.
    You will need to change those definitions in your models.

  %p
    Note that gemcutter is sorting the gems funkily, so when upgrading
    Mongoid for now you will have to specify the exact version. If you are
    using bundler then it takes care of this for you. The gems in the way
    will get yanked soon.

.title Upgrading to 2.0.0.beta.11 +
.text
  %p
    The <tt>Mongoid.use_object_ids</tt> configuration option has been removed
    and will need to be removed from your mongoid.yml or configuration block.

  %p
    If you had been using the default <tt>String</tt> representation of
    <tt>BSON::ObjectID</tt> as your ids, you will need to do one of the following
    options:

  %p
    a) Tell each one of your models to use <tt>Strings</tt> as ids like so:

  %pre
    %code.language-ruby
      :preserve
        class Person
          include Mongoid::Document
          identity :type => String
        end

  %p
    b) Migrate all your <tt>String</tt> ids over to <tt>ObjectIDs</tt> in your
    database. See <a href="http://gist.github.com/489098">This Gist</a> for an
    example script to do this. (Thanks Kyle Banker)

.title Upgrading to 2.0.0.beta.10 +
.text
  %p
    <tt>Passenger</tt> users who are using smart spawning must now remove
    their initializers with the reconnect on fork code. Mongoid now handles
    this for you.

  %p
    <tt>Unicorn</tt> users who set <tt>preload_app</tt> to <tt>true</tt>
    must also delete their initializers with the reconnect on fork code.
    Mongoid now handles this for you as well.
