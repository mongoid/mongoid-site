  %title Mongoid: Installation

%h1 installation

%h3 prerequisites

%p
  There are a few things you need to have in your toolbox before tackling
  a web application using Mongoid.

  %ul
    %li A good to advanced knowledge of Ruby.
    %li Have good knowledge of your web framework if using one.
    %li A thorough understanding of MongoDB.

%p
  This may seem like a "thank you Captain Obvious" moment, however if you
  believe that you can just hop over to Mongoid because you read a blog
  post on how cool Ruby and MongoDB were, you are in for a
  <i>world of pain</i>.

%p
  Mongoid leverages many aspects of the Ruby programming
  language that are not for beginner use, and sending the core
  team into a frenzy tracking down a bug for a common Ruby mistake is a
  waste of our time, and all of the other users of the framework as well.

%p
  <i>THE DATABASE IS NOT A BLACK BOX</i>.

%p
  Mongoid is an abstraction to make application developers'
  lives easier, however the internals leverage the
  power of MongoDB and it is truly important to know what is going on
  under the covers. This is why the documentation provides the exact
  queries that Mongoid is executing against the database when you call a
  persistence operation. If we took the time to tell you, you should listen. :)

%h3 okay, now i'm ready

%p
  The preferred method for installing Mongoid is with bundler. Add the Mongoid
  and optional BSON extenstions to your Gemfile:

:coderay
  #!ruby
  gem "mongoid", "~> 2.0"
  gem "bson_ext", "~> 1.3"

%p
  Alternatively you can get the Mongoid gem direcly from rubygems.org:

:coderay
  #!ruby
  $ gem install mongoid bson_ext

%p
  Note for performance improvements you will want to also install the bson c
  extensions if compatible with your system, however it is not a direct
  dependency of Mongoid in case it is not compatible.
