  %title Mongoid: Relations [Validations]

%h1 validations

%p
  It is important to note that by default, Mongoid will validate the
  children of any relation that are loaded into memory. The relations that
  this applies to are:

  %ul
    %li <tt>embeds_many</tt>
    %li <tt>embeds_one</tt>
    %li <tt>has_many</tt>
    %li <tt>has_one</tt>
    %li <tt>has_and_belongs_to_many</tt>

%p
  If you do not want this behaviour, you may turn it off when defining
  the relation.

    embeds_many :addresses, validate: false
    has_many :posts, validate: false
