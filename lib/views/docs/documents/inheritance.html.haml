  %title Mongoid: Documents [Inheritance]

%h1 inheritance

%p
  Mongoid supports inheritance in both root and embedded documents. In
  scenarios where documents are inherited from their fields, relations,
  validations and scopes get copied down into their child documents, but
  not vise-versa.

  #!ruby
  class Canvas
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    embeds_many :shapes
  end

  class Browser < Canvas
    field :version, type: Integer
    scope :recent, where(:version.gt => 3)
  end

  class Firefox < Browser
  end

  class Shape
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :x, type: Integer
    field :y, type: Integer
    embedded_in :canvas
  end

  class Circle < Shape
    field :radius, type: Float
  end

  class Rectangle < Shape
    field :width, type: Float
    field :height, type: Float
  end

%p
  In the above example, <tt>Canvas</tt>, <tt>Browser</tt> and
  <tt>Firefox</tt> will all save in the <tt>canvases</tt> collection.
  An additional attribute <tt>_type</tt> is stored in order
  to make sure when loaded from the database the correct document is
  returned. This also holds true for the embedded documents <tt>Circle</tt>,
  <tt>Rectangle</tt>, and <tt>Shape</tt>.
