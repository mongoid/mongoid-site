  %title Mongoid: Documents

%h1 Documents

%p
  Documents are the core objects in Mongoid and any object that is to be
  persisted to the database must include <code>Mongoid::Document</code>. The
  representation of a Document in MongoDB is a BSON object that is very similar
  to a Ruby hash or JSON object. Documents can be stored in their own
  collections in the database, or can be embedded in other Documents n levels
  deep.

%section#storage
  %h2 Storage

  %p
    Mongoid by default stores documents in a collection that is the pluralized
    form of the class name. For the following <code>Person</code> class, the
    collection the document would get stored in would be named <code>people</code>.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    class Person
      include Mongoid::Document
    end

  %p
    Model class name cannot end with "s", because it will be considered as
    the pluralized form of the word. For example <code>Status</code> would be considered
    as the plural form of <code>Statu</code>, which will cause a few known problems.

  %p
    This is a limitation of the <code>ActiveSupport::Inflector#classify</code> which
    Mongoid uses to convert from filenames and collection names to class names.
    You can overcome this by specifying a custom inflection rule for your model class.
    For example, the following code will take care of the model named <code>Status</code>

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections do |inflect|
      inflect.singular("status", "status")
    end

  %p
    The collection for the model's documents can be changed at the class level
    if you would like them persisted elsewhere. You can also change the database
    and session the model gets persisted in from the defaults.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    class Person
      include Mongoid::Document
      store_in collection: "citizens", database: "other", session: "secondary"
    end

  %p
    The <code>store_in</code> macro can also take lambdas - a common case for this
    is multi-tenant applications.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    class Band
      include Mongoid::Document
      store_in database: ->{ Thread.current[:database] }
    end

  %p
    When a document is stored in the database the ruby object will get
    serialized into BSON and have a structure like so:

  :coderay
    #!javascript
    {
      "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9"),
      "title" : "Sir",
      "name" : {
        "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7ff"),
        "first_name" : "Durran"
      },
      "addresses" : [
        {
          "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e0"),
          "city" : "Berlin",
          "country" : "Deutschland"
        }
      ]
    }

%section#fields
  %h2 Fields

  %p
    Even though MongoDB is a schemaless database, most uses will be with
    web applications where form parameters always come to the server as strings.
    Mongoid provides an easy mechanism for transforming these strings into
    their appropriate types through the definition of fields in a
    <code>Mongoid::Document</code>.

  %p
    Consider a simple class for modeling a person in an application. A person may
    have a first name, last name, and middle name. We can define these
    attributes on a person by using the fields macro.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    class Person
      include Mongoid::Document
      field :first_name, type: String
      field :middle_name, type: String
      field :last_name, type: String
    end

  %p
    Below is a list of valid types for fields.

    %ul
      %li <code>Array</code>
      %li <code>BigDecimal</code>
      %li <code>Boolean</code>
      %li <code>Date</code>
      %li <code>DateTime</code>
      %li <code>Float</code>
      %li <code>Hash</code>
      %li <code>Integer</code>
      %li <code>BSON::ObjectId</code>
      %li <code>Moped::BSON::Binary</code>
      %li <code>Range</code>
      %li <code>Regexp</code>
      %li <code>String</code>
      %li <code>Symbol</code>
      %li <code>Time</code>
      %li <code>TimeWithZone</code>

  %p
    If you decide not to specify the type of field with the definition, Mongoid
    will treat it as an object and not try to typecast it when sending the
    values to the database. This can be advantageous in 2 places, since
    the lack of attempted conversion will yield a slight performance gain. However
    some fields are not supported if not defined as fields. A note of thumb for
    what fields you can use are:

    %ul
      %li You're not using a web front end and values are already properly cast.
      %li All of your fields are strings.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    class Person
      include Mongoid::Document
      field :first_name
      field :middle_name
      field :last_name
    end

  %p
    Types that are not supported as dynamic attributes since they cannot be cast
    are:

    %ul
      %li <code>BigDecimal</code>
      %li <code>Date</code>
      %li <code>DateTime</code>
      %li <code>Range</code>

  %a{ name: "getters_and_setters" }
  %h3 Getting and setting field values

  %p
    When a field is defined, Mongoid provides several different ways of
    accessing the field.

  :coderay
    #!ruby

    # Get the value of the first name field.
    person.first_name
    person[:first_name]
    person.read_attribute(:first_name)

    # Set the value for the first name field.
    person.first_name = "Jean"
    person[:first_name] = "Jean"
    person.write_attribute(:first_name, "Jean")

  %p
    In cases where you want to set multiple field values at once, there are a
    few different ways of handling this as well.

  :coderay
    #!ruby

    # Get the field values as a hash.
    person.attributes

    # Set the field values in the document.
    Person.new(first_name: "Jean-Baptiste", middle_name: "Emmanuel")
    person.attributes = { first_name: "Jean-Baptiste", middle_name: "Emmanuel" }
    person.write_attributes(
      first_name: "Jean-Baptiste",
      middle_name: "Emmanuel"
    )

  %a{ name: "hash_field_keys" }
  %h3 Hash Field Keys

  %p
    When using a field of type <code>Hash</code>, be wary of adhering to the
    = link_to "legal key names for mongoDB", "http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Legal+Key+Names"
    , or else the values will not store properly.

  :coderay
    #!ruby

    class Person
      include Mongoid::Document
      field :first_name
      field :url, type: Hash

      # will update the fields properly and save the values
      def set_vals
        self.first_name = 'Daniel'
        self.url = {'home_page' => 'http://www.homepage.com'}
        save
      end

      # all data will fail to save due to the illegal hashkey
      def set_vals_fail
        self.first_name = 'Daniel'
        self.url = {'home.page' => 'http://www.homepage.com'}
        save
      end
    end

  %a{ name: "field_defaults" }
  %h3 Defaults

  %p
    You can tell a field in Mongoid to always have a default value if nothing
    has been provided. Defaults are either static values or lambdas.

  :coderay
    #!ruby

    class Person
      include Mongoid::Document
      field :blood_alcohol_level, type: Float, default: 0.40
      field :last_drink, type: Time, default: ->{ 10.minutes.ago }
    end

  %p
    Be wary that default values that are not defined as lambdas or procs are
    evaluated at class load time, so the following 2 definitions are not
    equivalent. (You probably would prefer the second, which is at document
    creation time.)

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    field :dob, type: Time, default: Time.now
    field :dob, type: Time, default: ->{ Time.now }

  %p
    If you want to set a default with a dependency on the document's state,
    <code>self</code> inside a lambda or proc evaluates to the document instance.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    field :wasted_at, type: Time, default: ->{ new_record? ? 2.hours.ago : Time.now }

  .well
    %table
      %tr
        %td.achtung= image_tag "/images/achtung.png"
        %td.note
          When defining a default value as a proc, Mongoid will apply the default
          after all other attributes are set. If you want this to happen before
          the other attributes, set <code>pre_processed: true</code>.

  %a{ name: "field_aliasing" }
  %h3 Field Aliasing

  %p
    One of the drawbacks of having a schemaless database is that MongoDB must
    store all field information along with every document, meaning that it takes
    up a lot of storage space in RAM and on disk. A common pattern to limit this
    is to alias fields to a small number of characters, while keeping the
    domain in the application expressive. Mongoid allows you to do this and
    reference the fields in the domain via their long names in getters, setters,
    and criteria while performing the conversion for you.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    class Band
      include Mongoid::Document
      field :n, as: :name, type: String
    end

    band = Band.new(name: "Placebo")
    band.attributes #=> { "n" => "Placebo" }

    criteria = Band.where(name: "Placebo")
    criteria.selector #=> { "n" => "Placebo" }

  %a{ name: "custom_fields" }
  %h3 Custom field serialization

  %p
    You can define custom types in Mongoid and determine how they are
    serialized and deserialized. You simply need to provide 3 methods on it
    for Mongoid to call to convert your object to and from MongoDB friendly
    values.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    class Profile
      include Mongoid::Document
      field :location, type: Point
    end

    class Point

      attr_reader :x, :y

      def initialize(x, y)
        @x, @y = x, y
      end

      # Converts an object of this instance into a database friendly value.
      def mongoize
        [ x, y ]
      end

      class << self

        # Get the object as it was stored in the database, and instantiate
        # this custom class from it.
        def demongoize(object)
          Point.new(object[0], object[1])
        end

        # Takes any possible object and converts it to how it would be
        # stored in the database.
        def mongoize(object)
          case object
          when Point then object.mongoize
          when Hash then Point.new(object[:x], object[:y]).mongoize
          else object
          end
        end

        # Converts the object that was supplied to a criteria and converts it
        # into a database friendly form.
        def evolve(object)
          case object
          when Point then object.mongoize
          else object
          end
        end
      end
    end

  %p
    The instance method <code>mongoize</code> take an instance of your object,
    and converts it into how it will be stored in the database. In our example
    above, we want to store our point object as an array in the form
    <code>[ x, y ]</code>.

  %p
    The class method <code>demongoize</code> takes an object as how it was
    stored in the database, and is responsible for instantiating an object of
    your custom type. In this case, we take an array and instantiate a
    <code>Point</code> from it.

  %p
    The class method <code>mongoize</code> takes an object that you would use
    to set on your model from your application code, and create the object as
    it would be stored in the database. This is for cases where you are not
    passing your model instances of your custom type in the setter:

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    point = Point.new(12, 24)
    venue = Venue.new(location: point) #=> This uses the mongoize instance method.
    venue = Venue.new(location: [ 12, 24 ]) #=> This uses the mongoize class method.

  %p
    The class method <code>evolve</code> takes an object, and determines how it
    is to be transformed for use in criteria. For example we may want to write
    a query like so:

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    point = Point.new(12, 24)
    Venue.where(location: point)

  .well
    %table
      %tr
        %td.achtung= image_tag "/images/achtung.png"
        %td.note
          When accessing custom fields from the document, you will get a new
          instance of that object with each call to the getter. This is
          because Mongoid is generating a new object from the object from the
          raw attributes on each access.

  %p
    We need the point object in the criteria to be transformed to a Mongo
    friendly value when it is not as well, and <code>evolve</code> is the method
    that takes care of this. We check if the passed in object is a <code>Point</code>
    first, in case we also want to be able to pass in ordinary arrays instead.

  %a{ name: "reserved_field_names" }
  %h3 Reserved names

  %p
    If you define a field on your document that conflicts with a reserved method
    name in Mongoid, the configuration will raise an error. For a list of these
    you may look at <code>Mongoid.destructive_fields</code>.

  %a{ name: "custom_ids" }
  %h3 Creating Custom Ids

  %p
    For cases when you do not want to have <code>BSON::ObjectId</code> ids, you
    can override Mongoid's <code>_id</code> field and set them to whatever you
    like.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    class Band
      include Mongoid::Document
      field :name, type: String
      field :_id, type: String, default: ->{ name }
    end

%section#dynamic_fields
  %h2 Dynamic fields

  %p
    By default Mongoid doesn't supports dynamic fields. You can tell mongoid that you want to add dynamic fields by including 'Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic' in model.
    'Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic' will allow
    attributes to get set and persisted on the document even if a field was not
    defined for them. There is a slight 'gotcha' however when dealing with
    dynamic attributes in that Mongoid is not completely lenient about the use of
    <code>method_missing</code> and breaking the public interface of the Document
    class.

    :coderay
      #!ruby
      class Person
        include Mongoid::Document
        include Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic
      end
  %p
    When dealing with dynamic attributes the following rules apply:

  %p
    If the attribute exists in the document, Mongoid will provide you with your
    standard getter and setter methods. For example, consider a person who has an
    attribute of "gender" set on the document:

  :coderay
    #!ruby

    # Set the person's gender to male.
    person[:gender] = "Male"
    person.gender = "Male"

    # Get the person's gender.
    person.gender

  %p
    If the attribute does not already exist on the document, Mongoid will not
    provide you with the getters and setters and will enforce normal
    <code>method_missing</code> behavior. In this case you must use the other
    provided accessor methods: (<code>[]</code> and <code>[]=</code>) or
    (<code>read_attribute</code> and <code>write_attribute</code>).

  :coderay
    #!ruby

    # Raise a NoMethodError if value isn't set.
    person.gender
    person.gender = "Male"

    # Retrieve a dynamic field safely.
    person[:gender]
    person.read_attribute(:gender)

    # Write a dynamic field safely.
    person[:gender] = "Male"
    person.write_attribute(:gender, "Male")


%section#localized_fields
  %h2 Localized fields

  %p
    From 2.4.0 Mongoid now supports localized fields without the need of any
    external gem.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    class Product
      include Mongoid::Document
      field :description, localize: true
    end

  %p
    By telling the field to <code>localize</code>, Mongoid will under the covers
    store the field as a hash of locale/value pairs, but normal access to it will
    behave like a string.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    I18n.default_locale = :en
    product = Product.new
    product.description = "Marvelous!"
    I18n.locale = :de
    product.description = "Fantastisch!"

    product.attributes
    #=> { "description" => { "en" => "Marvelous!", "de" => "Fantastisch!" }

  %p
    You can get and set all the translations at once by using the
    corresponding <code>_translations</code> method.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    product.description_translations
    #=> { "en" => "Marvelous!", "de" => "Fantastisch!" }
    product.description_translations =
      { "en" => "Marvelous!", "de" => "Wunderbar!" }

  %h3 Fallbacks

  %p
    When using fallbacks, Mongoid will automatically use them when a translation
    is not available.

  %p
    For Rails applications, set the fallbacks configuration setting to true in
    your environment.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    config.i18n.fallbacks = true

  %p
    For non-rails applications, you must include the fallbacks module straight
    to the I18n gem.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    require "i18n/backend/fallbacks"
    I18n::Backend::Simple.send(:include, I18n::Backend::Fallbacks)

  %p
    Then when the fallbacks are defined, if a translation is not present Mongoid
    will fallback in order of the defined locales.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    I18n.default_locale = :en
    I18n.fallbacks = true
    ::I18n.fallbacks[:de] = [ :de, :en, :es ]
    product = Product.new
    product.description = "Marvelous!"
    I18n.locale = :de
    product.description #=> "Marvelous!"

  %h3 Querying

  %p
    When querying for localized fields using Mongoid's criteria API, Mongoid
    will automatically alter the criteria to match the current locale.

  %mongoid mongoid
  :coderay
    #!ruby
    # Match all prodcucts with Marvelous as the description. Locale is en.
    Product.where(description: "Marvelous!")

  %mongodb mongodb query selector
  :coderay
    #!ruby
    { "description.en" : "Marvelous!" }

  %h3 Indexing

  %p
    If you plan to be querying extensively on localized fields, you should index
    each of the locales that you plan on searching on.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    class Product
      include Mongoid::Document
      field :description, localize: true

      index "description.de" => 1
      index "description.en" => 1
    end

  %h3 Validation

  %p
    Mongoid's presence validator will make sure that translations are present
    for all locales that are in the underlying hash.

%section#dirty
  %h2 Dirty Tracking

  %p
    Mongoid supports tracking of changed or "dirty" fields with an API that
    mirrors that of Active Model. If a defined field has been modified in
    a model the model will be marked as dirty and some additional behavior
    comes into play.

  %h3 Viewing changes

  %p
    There are various ways to view what has been altered on a model. Changes
    are recorded from the time a document is instantiated, either as a
    new document or via loading from the database up to the time it is
    saved. Any persistence operation clears the changes.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    class Person
      include Mongoid::Document
      field :name, type: String
    end

    person = Person.first
    person.name = "Alan Garner"

    # Check to see if the document has changed.
    person.changed? #=> true

    # Get an array of the names of the changed fields.
    person.changed #=> [ :name ]

    # Get a hash of the old and changed values for each field.
    person.changes #=> { "name" => [ "Alan Parsons", "Alan Garner" ] }

    # Check if a specific field has changed.
    person.name_changed? #=> true

    # Get the changes for a specific field.
    person.name_change #=> [ "Alan Parsons", "Alan Garner" ]

    # Get the previous value for a field.
    person.name_was #=> "Alan Parsons"

  %h3 Resetting changes

  %p
    You can reset changes of a field to its previous value by calling the
    reset method.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    person = Person.first
    person.name = "Alan Garner"

    # Reset the changed name back to the original
    person.reset_name!
    person.name #=> "Alan Parsons"

  %h3 Notes on persistence

  %p
    Mongoid uses dirty tracking as the core of its persistence operations.
    It looks at the changes on a document and atomically updates only what
    has changed unlike other frameworks that write the entire document on
    each save. If no changes have been made, Mongoid will not hit the database
    on a call to <code>Model#save</code>.

  %h3 Viewing previous changes

  %p
    After a document has been persisted, you can see what the changes were
    previously by calling <code>Model#previous_changes</code>

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    person = Person.first
    person.name = "Alan Garner"
    person.save #=> Clears out current changes.

    # View the previous changes.
    person.previous_changes #=> { "name" => [ "Alan Parsons", "Alan Garner" ] }

%section#security
  %h2 Security

  %p
    There are cases where you don't want Mongoid to allow attributes to be
    set through mass assignment, like passwords. This is a common event when
    submitting forms, and fields can be protected by using Mongoid's
    <code>attr_protected</code> or <code>attr_accessible</code> thanks to the
    wonders of Active Model.

  .well
    %table
      %tr
        %td.achtung= image_tag "/images/achtung.png"
        %td.note
          Mongoid auto-protects the <code>_id</code> and <code>_type</code>
          attributes by default.

  %h3 Protected

  %p
    When defining a list of fields as protected, all other fields in the
    document will NOT be able to be set through mass assignment.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    class User
      include Mongoid::Document
      field :first_name, type: String
      field :password, type: String
      attr_protected :password
    end

    # Set attributes on a person properly.
    Person.new(first_name: "Corbin")
    person.attributes = { first_name: "Corbin" }
    person.write_attributes(first_name: "Corbin")

    # Attempt to set attributes a person, logging an error.
    Person.new(first_name: "Corbin", password: "password")
    person.attributes = { first_name: "Corbin", password: "password" }
    person.write_attributes(first_name: "Corbin", password: "password")

  %h3 Accessible

  %p
    Providing a list of fields as accessible is simply the inverse of
    protecting them. Anything not defined as accessible will cause the
    error.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    class User
      include Mongoid::Document
      field :first_name, type: String
      field :password, type: String
      attr_accessible :first_name
    end

    # Set attributes on a user properly.
    User.new(first_name: "Corbin")
    user.attributes = { first_name: "Corbin" }
    user.write_attributes(first_name: "Corbin")

    # Attempt to set attributes on a user, will silently ignore protected ones.
    User.new(first_name: "Corbin", password: "password")
    user.attributes = { first_name: "Corbin", password: "password" }
    user.write_attributes(first_name: "Corbin", password: "password")

  %p
    You can scope the mass assignment by role by providing the role as an
    option to the constructor or create methods.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    class User
      include Mongoid::Document
      field :first_name, type: String
      field :password, type: String
      attr_accessible :first_name, as: [ :default, :admin ]
    end

    # Set attributes on a person for the admin role
    Person.new({ first_name: "Corbin" }, as: :admin)
    Person.create({ first_name: "Corbin" }, as: :default)
    Person.create!({ first_name: "Corbin" }, as: :admin)

  %h3 Overriding

  %p
    In the case you want to override the security in a single call,
    you can pass a block to the document constructor to set fields manually.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    Person.new(first_name: "Corbin") do |person|
      person.password = "password"
    end

%section#readonly
  %h2 Readonly Attributes

  %p
    You can tell Mongoid that certain attributes are readonly. This will
    allow documents to be created with theses attributes, but changes to
    them will be filtered out.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    class Band
      include Mongoid::Document
      field :name, type: String
      field :origin, type: String

      attr_readonly :name, :origin
    end

    band = Band.create(name: "Placebo")
    band.update_attributes(name: "Tool") # Filters out the name change.

  %p
    If you explicitly try to update or remove the attribute by itself, then
    a <code>ReadonlyAttribute</code> error will be raised.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    band.update_attribute(:name, "Tool") # Raises the error.
    band.remove_attribute(:name) # Raises the error.

%section#inheritance
  %h2 Inheritance

  %p
    Mongoid supports inheritance in both root and embedded documents. In
    scenarios where documents are inherited from their fields, relations,
    validations and scopes get copied down into their child documents, but
    not vise-versa.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    class Canvas
      include Mongoid::Document
      field :name, type: String
      embeds_many :shapes
    end

    class Browser < Canvas
      field :version, type: Integer
      scope :recent, where(:version.gt => 3)
    end

    class Firefox < Browser
    end

    class Shape
      include Mongoid::Document
      field :x, type: Integer
      field :y, type: Integer
      embedded_in :canvas
    end

    class Circle < Shape
      field :radius, type: Float
    end

    class Rectangle < Shape
      field :width, type: Float
      field :height, type: Float
    end

  %p
    In the above example, <code>Canvas</code>, <code>Browser</code> and
    <code>Firefox</code> will all save in the <code>canvases</code> collection.
    An additional attribute <code>_type</code> is stored in order
    to make sure when loaded from the database the correct document is
    returned. This also holds true for the embedded documents <code>Circle</code>,
    <code>Rectangle</code>, and <code>Shape</code>.

  %h3 Querying for Subclasses

  %p
    Querying for subclasses is handled in the normal manner, and although
    the documents are all in the same collection, queries will only return
    documents of the correct type, similar to Single Table Inheritance in
    ActiveRecord.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    # Returns Canvas documents and subclasses
    Canvas.where(name: "Paper")
    # Returns only Firefox documents
    Firefox.where(name: "Window 1")

  %h3 Associations

  %p
    You can add any type of subclass to a has one or has many association,
    through either normal setting or through the build and create methods
    on the association:

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    firefox = Firefox.new
    # Builds a Shape object
    firefox.shapes.build({ x: 0, y: 0 })
    # Builds a Circle object
    firefox.shapes.build({ x: 0, y: 0 }, Circle)
    # Creates a Rectangle object
    firefox.shapes.create({ x: 0, y: 0 }, Rectangle)

    rect = Rectangle.new(width: 100, height: 200)
    firefox.shapes
