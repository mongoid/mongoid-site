%section#prerequisites
  %h2 Prerequisites

  %p
    There are a few things you need to have in your toolbox before tackling
    a web application using Mongoid.

    %ul
      %li A good to advanced knowledge of Ruby.
      %li Have good knowledge of your web framework if using one.
      %li A thorough understanding of MongoDB.

  %p
    This may seem like a "thank you Captain Obvious" moment, however if you
    believe that you can just hop over to Mongoid because you read a blog
    post on how cool Ruby and MongoDB were, you are in for a
    <i>world of pain</i>.

  %p
    Mongoid leverages many aspects of the Ruby programming
    language that are not for beginner use, and sending the core
    team into a frenzy tracking down a bug for a common Ruby mistake is a
    waste of our time, and all of the other users of the framework as well.

        %td.note
          %p
            <i>THE DATABASE IS NOT A BLACK BOX</i>.
          Mongoid is an abstraction to make application developers'
          lives easier, however the internals leverage the
          power of MongoDB and it is truly important to know what is going on
          under the covers. This is why the documentation provides the exact
          queries that Mongoid is executing against the database when you call a
          persistence operation. If we took the time to tell you, you should listen. :)

%section#installation
  %h2 Installation

  %p
    The preferred method for installing Mongoid is with bundler. Simply add
    Mongoid to your <code>Gemfile</code>.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    gem "mongoid", "~> 3.0.0"

  %p
    Alternatively you can get the Mongoid gem direcly from rubygems.org:

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    $ gem install mongoid

  .well
    %table
      %tr
        %td.achtung= image_tag "/images/achtung.png"
        %td.note
          The minimum version of MongoDB that is required for you to run Mongoid 3
          is <code>2.0.0</code>.

%section#configuration
  %h2 Configuration

  %p
    Mongoid configuration can be done through a <code>mongoid.yml</code> that
    specifies your options and database sessions. The simplest configuration
    is as follows, which sets the default session to "localhost:27017"
    and provides a single database in that session named "mongoid".

  :coderay
    #!yaml
    development:
      sessions:
        default:
          database: mongoid
          hosts:
            - localhost:27017

  %h3 Rails Applications

  %p
    You can generate a config file by executing the generator and then editing
    <code>myapp/config/mongoid.yml</code> to your heart's desire. Mongoid will
    then handle everything else from there.

  :coderay
    #!text
    $ rails g mongoid:config

  %p
    When Mongoid loads its configuration, it chooses the environment to used
    based on the following order:

    %ul
      %li <code>Rails.env</code> if using Rails.
      %li <code>Sinatra::Base.environment</code> if using Sinatra.
      %li <code>RACK_ENV</code> environment variable.
      %li <code>MONGOID_ENV</code> environment variable.

  %p
    If you are not using any rack based application and want to override the
    environment programatically, you can pass a second paramter to <code>load!</code>
    and Mongoid will use that.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    Mongoid.load!("path/to/your/mongoid.yml", :production)


  %h3 Anatomy of a Mongoid Config

  %p
    Let's have a look at a full-blown <code>mongoid.yml</code> and explain
    the full power of what Mongoid can do. The following configuration has its
    explanation in the comments above each key.

  :coderay
    #!yaml
    # Tell Mongoid which environment this configuration is for.
    production:
      # This starts the session configuration settings. You may have as
      # many sessions as you like, but you must have at least 1 named
      # 'default'.
      sessions:
        # Define the default session.
        default:
          # A session can have any number of hosts. Usually 1 for a single
          # server setup, and at least 3 for a replica set. Hosts must be
          # an array of host:port pairs. This session is single server.
          hosts:
            - flame.mongohq.com:27017
          # Define the default database name.
          database: mongoid
          # Since this database points at a session connected to MongoHQ, we must
          # provide the authentication details.
          username: user
          password: password
        # This defines a secondary session at a replica set.
        replica_set:
          # This configuration is a 3 node replica set.
          hosts:
            - dedicated1.myapp.com:27017
            - dedicated2.myapp.com:27017
            - dedicated3.myapp.com:27017
          database: mongoid
          # We can set session specific options, like reads executing
          # on secondary nodes, and defaulting the session to safe mode.
          options:
            consistency: :eventual
            safe: true
        # This defines a tertiary session at a Mongos fronted shard.
        shard:
          # This configuration is a Mongos shard server.
          hosts:
            - mongos.myapp.com:27017
          database: mongoid
        # This configuration shows an authenticated replica set via a uri.
        another:
          uri: mongodb://user:pass@59.1.22.1:27017,59.1.22.2:27017/mongoid
      # Here we put the Mongoid specific configuration options. These are explained
      # in more detail next.
      options:
        allow_dynamic_fields: false
        identity_map_enabled: true
        include_root_in_json: true
        include_type_for_serialization: true
        # Note this can also be true if you want to preload everything, but this is
        # almost never necessary. Most of the time set this to false.
        preload_models:
          - Canvas
          - Browser
          - Firefox
        scope_overwrite_exception: true
        raise_not_found_error: false
        skip_version_check: false
        use_activesupport_time_zone: false
        use_utc: true

  %h3 Configuration options

  %p
    Mongoid currently supports the following configuration options, either
    provided in the mongoid.yml or programatically (defaults in
    parenthesis).


  %ul.config
    %li
      <code>allow_dynamic_fields</code>(true): When attributes are not defined
      as fields but added to an object, they will get fields added for them
      dynamically and will get persisted. If set to false an error will get
      raised when attempting to set a value that has no field defined.
    %li
      <code>identity_map_enabled</code>(false): When set to true Mongoid will store
      documents loaded from the database in the identity map by their ids, so
      subsequent database queries for the same document in the same unit of
      work do not hit the database. This is only for relation queries at the
      moment. See the identity map documentation for more info.
    %li
      <code>include_root_in_json</code>(false): When set to true mongoid will
      include the name of the root document and the name of each association
      as the root element when calling <code>#to_json</code> on a model.
    %li
      <code>include_type_for_serialization</code>(false): When set to true this will
      tell Mongoid to include the "_type" field when serializing to JSON and XML.
    %li
      <code>preload_models</code>(false): Tells Mongoid to preload application
      model classes on each request in environments where classes are not
      being cached. Specify an array of class names when enabling, only to the
      classes that use inheritance.
    %li
      <code>protect_sensitive_fields</code>(true): Mongoid by default will auto
      protect '_id' and '_type' from mass assignment. Set this to false if you
      are daring with your application's security.
    %li
      <code>raise_not_found_error</code>(true): Will raise a
      <code>Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound</code> when attempting to find a
      document by an id that doesnt exist. When set to false will only return
      nil for the same query.
    %li
      <code>skip_version_check</code>(false): If you are having issues
      authenticating against MongoHQ or MongoMachine because of access to the
      system collection being not allowed, set this to true.
    %li
      <code>scope_overwrite_exception</code>(false): This will instruct Mongoid
      to raise an error if you define a scope with the same name as an existing
      method.
    %li
      <code>use_activesupport_time_zone</code>(true): When in a Rails app will
      tell Mongoid to convert all times in the application to the local defined
      time zone in Active Support.
    %li
      <code>use_utc</code>(false): Instructs Mongoid to convert all times to
      UTC times in all cases.

  %h3 Getting Rid of Active Record

  %p
    Now that you have a <code>mongoid.yml</code> you can't wait to delete that
    pesky <code>database.yml</code>, right? Do it and you'll start getting
    <code>ActiveRecord</code> errors all over the place.
    You don't need ActiveRecord unless you're trying to use Mongo in concert
    with a SQL database. Here's how you remove ActiveRecord from the most
    recent version of Rails 3...

  %p
    Open <code>myapp/config/application.rb</code> and near the top, remove
    the line <code>require "rails/all"</code> and add the following lines
    so you end up with this:

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    require "action_controller/railtie"
    require "action_mailer/railtie"
    require "active_resource/railtie"
    require "rails/test_unit/railtie"
    # require "sprockets/railtie" # Uncomment this line for Rails 3.1+

  %p
    For Rails 3.2+ you'll also need to remove configuration options for
    Active Record that reside in your environments, ie
    <code>myapp/config/environments/development.rb</code>. Make sure the
    lines are commented out like as follows.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    # config.active_record.mass_assignment_sanitizer = :strict
    # config.active_record.auto_explain_threshold_in_seconds = 0.5

  %p
    For Rails 3.2.3+ you'll also need to comment out the following line in
    <code>myapp/config/application.rb</code>.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    # config.active_record.whitelist_attributes = true

  %p
    You can also generate your new rails app sans Active Record like so.

  :coderay
    #!text
    rails new app_name --skip-active-record

  %h3 Sinatra, Padrino, and others

  %p
    You can create your <code>mongoid.yml</code> and place it anywhere you like.
    Just be sure that on application initialization you do the following:

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    Mongoid.load!("path/to/your/mongoid.yml")

%section#logging
  %h2 Logging

  %p
    Changing logging options is done simply by telling Mongoid or Moped's
    logger to have a different level. Logging is turned off by default.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    module MyApplication
      class Application << Rails::Application
        Mongoid.logger.level = Logger::DEBUG
        Moped.logger.level = Logger::DEBUG
      end
    end

  %p
    If you want to change the logger instance, you can simply just set a
    new one.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    Mongoid.logger = Logger.new($stdout)
    Moped.logger = Logger.new($stdout)

%section#replica
  %h2 Replica Sets

  %p
    For replica sets, you only need to put each member of the replica set
    under the <code>hosts</code> section in your <code>mongoid.yml</code> -
    Mongoid and Moped will take care of the rest. The default consistency is
    <code>:eventual</code>, which means that reads will attempt to go to
    secondaries. If you don't want this, switch this option to
    <code>:strong</code>, which will send everything to the master node.

  :coderay
    #!yaml
    sessions:
      default:
        hosts:
          - repl0.myapp.com:27017
          - repl1.myapp.com:27017
          - repl3.myapp.com:27017
        database: mongoid
        options:
          consistency: :strong

%section#sharding
  %h2 Sharding

  %p
    If you are using Mongoid in a sharded MongoDB environment and want to tell
    Mongoid to include the shard keys in it's updates, specify this at the
    model class level.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    class Person
      include Mongoid::Document

      field :first_name, type: String
      field :last_name, type: String

      shard_key :first_name, :last_name
    end

  %p
    In your <code>mongoid.yml</code>, just ensure that you are pointed at the
    <code>mongos</code> server in your hosts.

  :coderay
    #!yaml
    sessions:
      default:
        hosts:
          - mongos.myapp.com:27017
        database: mongoid
        options:
          consistency: :eventual
