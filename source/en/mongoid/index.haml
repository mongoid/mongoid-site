%h1 Mongoid

%p
  Mongoid (pronounced mann-goyd) is an Object-Document-Mapper (ODM) for
  <a href="https://mongodb.org">MongoDB</a> written in Ruby. It was conceived in August,
  2009 during a whiskey-induced evening at the infamous Oasis in Florida,
  USA by <a href="https://github.com/durran">Durran Jordan</a>.

%p
  The philosophy of Mongoid is to provide a familiar API to Ruby developers
  who have been using Active Record or Data Mapper, while leveraging the
  power of MongoDB's schemaless and performant document-based design, dynamic
  queries, and atomic modifier operations.

%h2 Sample Syntax

.well
  %table
    %tr
      %td.achtung= image_tag "/images/achtung.png"
      %td.note
        Mongoid supports MRI 1.9.3+, and JRuby 1.6.0+ in
        1.9 mode. All code samples will use 1.9 syntax.
