%h1 Nested Attributes

%p
  Nested attributes allow you to save attributes on associated records
  through the parent. By default nested attribute updating is turned off for
  referential associations and turned on for embed associations.

%p
  You can enable it using the
  %tt accepts_nested_attributes_for
  class method.

%p When you enable nested attributes an attribute writer is defined on the model.

%p
  The attribute writer is named after the association,
  which means that in the following example, four new methods are
  added to your model:

%ul
  %li <tt>author_attributes=(attributes)</tt>
  %li <tt>pages_attributes=(attributes)</tt>
  %li <tt>publisher_attributes=(attributes)</tt>
  %li <tt>reviews_attributes=(attributes)</tt>

:coderay
  #!ruby

  class Book
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_one :author
    has_many :pages
    embeds_one :publisher
    embeds_many :reviews

    accepts_nested_attributes_for :author, :pages
  end

%p
  Note that the
  %tt :autosave
  option needs to be enabled for relational associations that
  %tt accepts_nested_attributes_for
  is used for if you don't want to manually save the relation on update.

:coderay
  #!ruby
  class Member
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_one :avatar, autosave: true
    accepts_nested_attributes_for :avatar
  end

%h3 One-to-one

%p Consider a Member model that has one Avatar:

:coderay
  #!ruby
  class Member
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_one :avatar
    accepts_nested_attributes_for :avatar
  end

%p Enabling nested attributes on a one-to-one association allows you to create the member and avatar in one go:

:coderay
  #!ruby
  params =
    { member:
      { name: "Jack", avatar_attributes: { icon: "smiling" } }
    }
  member = Member.create(params[:member])
  member.avatar.id # => 2
  member.avatar.icon # => 'smiling'

%p It also allows you to update the avatar through the member:

:coderay
  #!ruby
  params =
    { member:
      { avatar_attributes: { id: "2", icon: "sad" } }
    }
  member.update_attributes(params[:member])
  member.avatar.icon # => 'sad'

%p
  By default you will only be able to set and update attributes on the associated model.
  If you want to destroy the associated model through the
  %tt attributes
  hash, you have to
  enable it first using the
  %tt :allow_destroy
  option.

:coderay
  #!ruby
  class Member
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_one :avatar
    accepts_nested_attributes_for :avatar, :allow_destroy => true
  end

%p
  Now, when you add the
  %tt _destroy
  key to the
  %tt attributes
  hash,
  with a value that evaluates to true, you will destroy the associated model:

:coderay
  #!ruby
  member.avatar_attributes = { id: "2", _destroy: "1" }
  member.avatar.marked_for_destruction? # => true
  member.save
  member.reload.avatar # => nil

%p Note that the model will not be destroyed until the parent is saved.

%h3 One-to-many

%p Consider a member that has a number of posts:

:coderay
  #!ruby
  class Member
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_many :posts
    accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts
  end

%p
  You can now set or update attributes on an associated post
  model through the
  %tt attribute
  hash.

%p
  For each hash that does not have an
  %tt id key
  a new record will be instantiated,
  unless the hash also contains a
  %tt _destroy
  key that evaluates to true.

:coderay
  #!ruby
  params = { member: {
    name: "joe", posts_attributes: [
      { title: "Kari, the awesome Ruby documentation browser!" },
      { title: "The egalitarian assumption..." },
      { title: "", _destroy: "1" } # this will be ignored
    ]
  }}

  member = Member.create(params['member'])
  member.posts.length # => 2
  member.posts.first.title # => 'Kari, the awesome Ruby documentation browser!'
  member.posts.second.title # => 'The egalitarian assumption...'

%p
  You may also set a
  %tt :reject_if proc
  to silently ignore any new record hashes if they fail to pass your criteria.
  For example, the previous example could be rewritten as:

:coderay
  #!ruby
  class Member
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_many :posts
    accepts_nested_attributes_for \
      :posts,
      reject_if: proc { |attributes| attributes["title"].blank? }
  end

  params = { member: {
    name: "joe", posts_attributes: [
      { title: "Kari, the awesome Ruby documentation browser!" },
      { title: "The egalitarian assumption of the modern citizen" },
      { title: "" } # this will be ignored because of the :reject_if proc
    ]
  }}

  member = Member.create(params["member"])
  member.posts.length # => 2
  member.posts.first.title # => "Kari, the awesome Ruby documentation browser!"
  member.posts.second.title # => "The egalitarian assumption of the modern citizen"

%p
  Alternatively,
  %tt :reject_if
  also accepts a symbol for using methods:

:coderay
  #!ruby
  class Member
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_many :posts
    accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts, reject_if: :new_record?
  end

  class Member
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_many :posts
    accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts, reject_if: :reject_posts

    def reject_posts(attributed)
      attributed["title"].blank?
    end
  end

%p
  If the hash contains an
  %tt id key
  that matches an already associated record, the matching record will be modified:

:coderay
  #!ruby

  member.attributes = {
    name: "Joe",
    posts_attributes: [
      { id: 1, title: "[UPDATED] An, as of yet, undisclosed..." },
      { id: 2, title: "[UPDATED] other post" }
    ]
  }

  member.posts.first.title # => "[UPDATED] An, as of yet, undisclosed..."
  member.posts.second.title # => "[UPDATED] other post"

%p
  By default the associated records are protected from being destroyed.
  If you want to destroy any of the associated records through the
  %tt attributes hash
  , you have to enable it first using the
  %tt :allow_destroy option.
  This will
  allow you to also use the
  %tt _destroy
  key to destroy existing records:

:coderay
  #!ruby
  class Member
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_many :posts
    accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts, allow_destroy: true
  end

  params = { member: {
    posts_attributes: [{ id: "2", _destroy: "1" }]
  }}

  member.attributes = params["member"]
  member.posts.detect { |p| p.id == 2 }.marked_for_destruction? # => true
  member.posts.length # => 2
  member.save
  member.reload.posts.length # => 1

%h3 Many-to-Many

%p The behaviour is the same as in One-To-Many associations.

:coderay
  #!ruby
  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_and_belongs_to_many :social_circles
    accepts_nested_attributes_for :social_circles
  end

  class SocialCircle
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_and_belongs_to_many :people
  end
