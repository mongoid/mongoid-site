%section#usage
  %h2 Usage
  %p
    The identity map in Mongoid is a current aid to assist with excessive
    database queries in relations, and is necessary for eager loading to
    work.

  %p
    To enable the identity map, simply change the configuration option in
    your <code>mongoid.yml</code>.

  :coderay
    #!yaml
    identity_map_enabled: true

  %p
    When a document is now loaded from the database, is is automatically
    added to the identity map by it's class and id. Subsequent request for
    that document by it's id will not hit the database, but rather pull
    the document back from the identity map itself. It's primary function
    in this capacity is to aid in cutting down queries for belongs_to
    relations when iterating over the parents.

  %p
    You can access documents in the map directly via the <tt>get</tt> method.
    It requires the class of the document you want and an id.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    Mongoid::IdentityMap.get(Person, id)

  %p
    When performing <code>Model.find</code> queries with the identity map
    enabled, Mongoid will automatically look for the document in the
    identity map first and return it if it exists before hitting the database.

%section#unit_of_work
  %h2 The Unit of Work

  %p
    To prevent database objects from becoming stale, the documents in the
    identity map should only exist in a single unit of work, which is
    usually a single request to the application.

  %h3 Rails

  %p
    No extra work is needed for Rails users, Mongoid will automatically
    clear out the identity map after each request.

  %h3 Sinatra

  %p
    You can require the Mongoid identity map middleware in your application
    to clear out the map with each request:

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    use Rack::Mongoid::Middleware::IdentityMap

  %h3 Non Rack Based Applications

  %p
    For users not using rack based apps, you will need to wrap your requests
    or application defined unit of work in a <code>Mongoid.unit_of_work</code>
    block:

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    Mongoid.unit_of_work do
      Person.create(title: "Grand Poobah")
    end

  .well
    %table
      %tr
        %td.samurai= image_tag "/images/samurai.png"
        %td.note
          %p
            The unit of work can also be used to temporarily disable the
            identity map and force documents to load from the database.

  :coderay
    #!ruby

    # Disable the identity map for the current thread only.
    Mongoid.unit_of_work(disable: :current) do
      Band.find(1)
    end

    # Disable the identity map for all threads.
    Mongoid.unit_of_work(disable: :all) do
      Band.find(1)
    end

  %h3 Rake Tasks and Background Jobs

  %p
    It is important to note that you should never be using the identity map
    when executing background jobs, rake tasks, etc. unless you really know
    that not many documents will be loaded and memory consumption will be
    low. Otherwise it's a server takedown waiting to happen.

  %p
    In these cases it's best to wrap your task or job in a unit of work.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    desc "A long running rake task"
    task "db:migrate_data" => :environment do
      Mongoid.unit_of_work(disable: :all) do
        # Do my work here.
      end
    end

    class BackgroundJob
      @queue = :background

      def self.perform(id)
        Mongoid.unit_of_work(disable: :all) do
          # Do work here.
        end
      end
    end

%section#testing
  %h2 Testing

  %p
    If you have the identity map enabled in your application, you should set up
    a global hook to clear out the map before each test so the test suite does
    not create memory bloat. For example in RSpec in <code>spec_helper.rb</code>.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    RSpec.configure do |config|
      config.before(:each) { Mongoid::IdentityMap.clear }
    end
