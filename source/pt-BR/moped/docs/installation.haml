  %p
    The preferred method for installing Moped is with bundler. Simply add
    Moped to your <code>Gemfile</code>.

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    gem "moped", "~> 1.1.1"

  %p
    Alternatively you can get the Moped gem direcly from rubygems.org:

  :coderay
    #!ruby
    $ gem install moped

  %p
    Moped has no external dependencies and no C or Java extensions, so
    installation should have no issues on any operating system.

  %p
    Moped provides no API around GridFS or Map/Reduce, but both are possible
    by implementing your own functionality around it.
