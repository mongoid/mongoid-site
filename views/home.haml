%h1 mongoid

%p
  Mongoid (pronounced mann-goyd) is an Object-Document-Mapper (ODM) for
  <a href="">MongoDB</a> written in Ruby. It was conceived in August,
  2009 during a whiskey-induced evening at the infamous Oasis in Florida,
  USA by <a href="">Durran Jordan</a>.

%p
  The philosophy of Mongoid is to provide a familiar API to Ruby developers
  who have been using Active Record or Data Mapper, while leveraging the
  power of MongoDB's schema-less and performant document-based design, dynamic
  queries, and atomic modifier operations.

%h2 sample syntax

:coderay
  #!ruby

  class Artist
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    embeds_many :instruments
  end

  class Instrument
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    embedded_in :artist
  end

  # Find the first artist named "Syd Vicious" and create an embedded bass
  # document for him. Of course he'll smash it within the next few minutes,
  # but no worries we can delete it later.
  Artist.where(name: "Syd Vicious").first.tap do |artist|
    artist.instruments.create(type: "Bass")
  end
