%h1 installation

%p
  The preferred method for installing Mongoid is with bundler. Add the Mongoid
  and optional BSON extension to your <tt>Gemfile</tt>:

:coderay
  #!ruby
  gem "mongoid", "~> 2.0"
  gem "bson_ext", "~> 1.2"

%p
  Alternatively you can get the Mongoid gem directly from rubygems.org:

:coderay
  #!ruby
  $ gem install mongoid bson_ext

%p
  Note for performance improvements you will want to also install the bson c
  extensions if compatible with your system, however it is not a direct
  dependency of Mongoid in case it is not compatible.
