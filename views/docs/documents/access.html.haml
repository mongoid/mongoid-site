  %title Mongoid: Documents [Access]

%h1 access

%p
  There are cases where you don't want Mongoid to allow attributes to be
  set through mass assignment, like passwords. This is a common event when
  submitting forms, and fields can be protected by using Mongoid's
  <tt>attr_protected</tt> or <tt>attr_accessible</tt> thanks to the
  wonders of Active Model.

%h3 protected

%p
  When defining a list of fields as protected, all other fields in the
  document will NOT be able to be set through mass assignment.

:coderay
  #!ruby
  class User
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :first_name, :type => String
    field :password, :type => String
    attr_protected :password
  end

  # Set attributes on a person properly.
  Person.new(:first_name => "Corbin")
  person.attributes = { :first_name => "Corbin" }
  person.write_attributes(:first_name => "Corbin")

  # Attempt to set attributes a person, raising an error.
  Person.new(:first_name => "Corbin", :password => "password")
  person.attributes = { :first_name => "Corbin", :password => "password" }
  person.write_attributes(:first_name => "Corbin", :password => "password")

%h3 accessible

%p
  Providing a list of fields as accessible is simply the inverse of
  protecting them. Anything not defined as accessible will cause the
  error.

:coderay
  #!ruby
  class User
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :first_name, :type => String
    field :password, :type => String
    attr_accessible :first_name
  end

  # Set attributes on a person properly.
  Person.new(:first_name => "Corbin")
  person.attributes = { :first_name => "Corbin" }
  person.write_attributes(:first_name => "Corbin")

  # Attempt to set attributes a person, raising an error.
  Person.new(:first_name => "Corbin", :password => "password")
  person.attributes = { :first_name => "Corbin", :password => "password" }
  person.write_attributes(:first_name => "Corbin", :password => "password")

%h3 overriding

%p
  In the case you want to override the security in a single call,
  you can pass a block to the document constructor to set fields manually.

:coderay
  #!ruby
  Person.new(:first_name => "Corbin") do |person|
    person.password = "password"
  end
