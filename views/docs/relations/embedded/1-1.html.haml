  %title Mongoid: Relations [Embedded: 1-1]

%h1 embedded one to one

%p= image_tag "/images/embedded-1-1.png", class: "diagram"

%p
  One to one relationships where the children are embedded in the parent
  document are defined using Mongoid's <tt>embeds_one</tt> and
  <tt>embedded_in</tt> macros.

%h3 defining

%p
  The parent document of the relation should use the <tt>embeds_one</tt>
  macro to indicate is has 1 embedded child, where the document that
  is embedded uses <tt>embedded_in</tt>.

:coderay
  #!ruby

  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document
    embeds_one :name
  end

  class Name
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :vorname, :type => String
    field :nachname, :type => String
    embedded_in :person
  end

%p
  Definitions are required on both sides to the relation in order for it to
  work properly.

%h3 storage

%p
  Documents that are embedded using the <tt>embeds_one</tt> macro are stored
  as a hash inside the parent in the parent's database collection.

:coderay
  #!javascript

  {
    "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9"),
    "name" : {
      "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e0"),
      "vorname" : "Heinrich",
      "nachname" : "Heine"
    }
  }

%h3 accessors

%p
  Accessing the relations is handled through the methods created based on the
  names of the relations. The following example shows basic access on both
  sides of the relation.

:coderay
  #!ruby

  # Return the child name.
  person.name

  # Set the child name.
  person.name = [ Name.new ]

  # Return the parent person.
  name.person

  # Set the parent person.
  name.person = Person.new

%h3 building and creating

%p
  From the parent side, documents in the embedded child can be initialized or
  created using the specially defined methods.

:coderay
  #!ruby

  # Create a new child name given the provided attributes.
  person.build_name(:vorname => "Heinrich", :nachname => "Heine")

  # Create a persisted child name.
  person.create_name(:vorname => "Heinrich", :nachname => "Heine")

  # Replace the parent with a new one from the attributes.
  name.build_person(:title => "Prince")

  # Replace the parent with a newly saved one from the attributes.
  name.create_person(:title => "Prince")

%h3 removal

%p
  Documents in the embedded many can be removed by either calling delete
  on the child or setting it to nil.

:coderay
  #!ruby

  # Delete the child document
  person.name.delete
  person.name.destroy
  person.name = nil

%h3 polymorphic behaviour

%p
  When a child embedded document can belong to more than one type of parent
  document, you can tell Mongoid to support this by adding the <tt>as</tt>
  option to the definition on the parents, and the <tt>polymorphic</tt>
  option on the child.

:coderay
  #!ruby

  class Doctor
    include Mongoid::Document
    embeds_one :name, as: :namable
  end

  class Nurse
    include Mongoid::Document
    embeds_one :name, as: :namable
  end

  class Name
    include Mongoid::Document
    embedded_in :namable, :polymorphic => true
  end
