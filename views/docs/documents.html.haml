  %title Mongoid: Documents

%h1 documents

%p
  Documents are the core objects in Mongoid and any object that is to be
  persisted to the database must include <tt>Mongoid::Document</tt>. The
  representation of a Document in MongoDB is a BSON object that is very similar
  to a Ruby hash or JSON object. Documents can be stored in their own
  collections in the database, or can be embedded in other Documents n levels
  deep.

%h3 storage

%p
  Mongoid by default stores documents in a collection that is the pluralized
  form of the class name. For the following <tt>Person</tt> class, the
  collection the document would get stored in would be named <tt>people</tt>.

:coderay
  #!ruby
  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document
  end

%p
  NOTE: Model class name cannot end with "s", because it will be considered as
  the pluralized form of the word. For example <tt>Status</tt> would be considered
  as the plural form of <tt>Statu</tt>, which will cause a few known problems.

%p
  This is a limitation of the <tt>ActiveSupport::Inflector#classify</tt> which
  Mongoid uses to convert from filenames and collection names to class names.
  You can overcome this by specifying a custom inflection rule for your model class.
  For example, the following code will take care of the model named <tt>Status</tt>

:coderay
  #!ruby
  ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections do |inflect|
    inflect.singular("status", "status")
  end

%br

%p
  The collection for the model's documents can be changed at the class level
  if you would like them persisted elsewhere.

:coderay
  #!ruby
  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document
    store_in :citizens
  end

%p
  When a document is stored in the database the ruby object will get
  serialized into BSON and have a structure like so:

:coderay
  #!javascript
  {
    "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9"),
    "title" : "Sir",
    "name" : {
      "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7ff"),
      "first_name" : "Durran"
    },
    "addresses" : [
      {
        "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e0"),
        "city" : "Berlin",
        "country" : "Deutschland"
      }
    ]
  }
