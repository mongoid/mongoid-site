%h1 contributing

%p
  Mongoid is open source and embraces the social coding aspect of github.
  Here are some guidelines on contributing to the project and ensuring
  fast acceptance of your contributions.

%h3 core contributions

%p
  Fork the <a href="http://github.com/mongoid/mongoid">repo on github</a>
  and issue a pull request with your changes. No
  other means of supplying code to the team will be accepted.

%p
  Provide specs with your pull request if the existing specs do not cover
  the change. Pull requests that provide new functionality without specs
  will not be pulled in under any circumstance.

%h3 running the specs

%p
  Getting set up should require minimal effort:

  %ul
    %li Install MongoDB.
    %li Fork and clone the repository.
    %li Run <tt>gem install bundler</tt> to get the latest for the gemset.
    %li Run <tt>bundle install</tt> for dependencies.
    %li Run <tt>rake</tt> to execute all specs.

%p
  Mongoid provides a <a href="https://github.com/mynyml/watchr">watchr</a>
  script as well for easy automated testing. To run it from the project root:

:coderay
  #!ruby
  $ bundle exec watchr .watchr

%h3 spec guidelines

%p
  The following code demostrates the desired way to write a spec in Mongoid.
  For organization, specs are divided into two directories:
  <tt>spec/functional</tt> and <tt>spec/unit</tt>. Functional specs are
  those that test the full stack and hit the database, unit specs test
  a single class in isolation. It's not required to have both, but
  at least one or the other. Also adhere to these rules:

  %ul
    %li Use <tt>describe</tt> blocks for method names.
    %li Use <tt>context</tt> blocks for conditions.
    %li Prefer <tt>let</tt> over the use of instance variables.
    %li 1 assertion per example block.
    %li
      When describing methods, prefix with <tt>#</tt> for instance methods,
      <tt>.</tt> for class methods.

:coderay
  #!ruby
  require "spec_helper"

  describe Mongoid::Relations::Embedded::Many do

    before do
      Person.delete_all
    end

    describe "#=" do

      context "when the parent is a new record" do

        let(:person) do
          Person.new
        end

        let(:address) do
          Address.new
        end

        before do
          person.addresses = [ address ]
        end

        it "sets the target of the relation" do
          person.addresses.should == [ address ]
        end
      end
    end

    describe ".macro" do

      it "returns :embeds_many" do
        described_class.macro.should == :embeds_many
      end
    end
  end

%h3 coding guidelines

%p
  Mongoid has the design philosophy of having many fine grained, single purpose
  objects in its domain. It makes the design more flexible and much easier to
  test. If you find yourself refactoring at all, 
  <a href="http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/extractClass.html">extract class</a>
  is always a good refactoring technique to have in mind.

%p
  Here are some other simple rules that will help expidite your patch
  acceptance.

  %ul
    %li Keep method line counts small and easy to read.
    %li Do not fear the use of Ruby's <tt>tap</tt>.
    %li Copy and pasted code from another library will never be accepted.
    %li Provide API documentation in the form of YARD.

  module Mongoid # :nodoc:
    module Relations #:nodoc:

      # This module contains the core macros for defining relations between
      # documents. They can be either embedded or referenced (relational).
      module Macros
        extend ActiveSupport::Concern

        module ClassMethods #:nodoc:

        # Adds the relation back to the parent document. This macro is
        # necessary to set the references from the child back to the parent
        # document. If a child does not define this relation calling
        # persistence methods on the child object will cause a save to fail.
        #
        # @example Define the relation.
        #
        #   class Person
        #     include Mongoid::Document
        #     embeds_many :addresses
        #   end
        #
        #   class Address
        #     include Mongoid::Document
        #     embedded_in :person
        #   end
        #
        # @param [ Symbol ] name The name of the relation.
        # @param [ Hash ] options The relation options.
        # @param [ Proc ] block Optional block for defining extensions.
        def embedded_in(name, options = {}, &block)
          characterize(name, Embedded::In, options, &block).tap do |meta|
            self.embedded = true
            relate(name, meta)
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end

%h3 website contributions

%p
  The Mongoid website is open source as well, and hosted on github. It
  uses middleman as a static content generator, and additions to the
  documentation are always welcome. The same rules apply here:

%p
  Fork the <a href="http://github.com/mongoid/mongoid-site">repo on github</a>
  and issue a pull request with your changes. No
  other means of supplying code to the team will be accepted.

%p
  Getting set up here is easy as well:

  %ul
    %li Fork and clone the repository.
    %li Run <tt>gem install bundler</tt> to get the latest for the gemset.
    %li Run <tt>bundle install</tt> for dependencies.
    %li Run <tt>bundle exec mm-server</tt> to run the site with sinatra.

%p
  Pull requests will be merged in and regenerated to the mongoid.github.com
  repo where you're contributions can be seen in all their glory.
