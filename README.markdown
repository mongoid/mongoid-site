# Documentation

These are the source files that power mongoid.org. It is a
[middleman](https://github.com/tdreyno/middleman) powered static page.

# Contributing

Please help Mongoid flesh out its documentation. We'll merge in any reasonable
extensions to our website docs, and give credit for your help!

# How to run the site locally

Clone this repo and using Ruby 1.9.2 run `bundle install`. Then
run `shotgun config.ru -p 3000` to start the server at http://localhost:3000

# Design Credits

The newly designed site is by Durran Jordan, logo design by Doris Steere, and
Omnigraffle wizardry by Gonzalo Rodríguez-Baltanás Díaz.

# Notes

All pages are written in haml, and for consistency must stay that way.
